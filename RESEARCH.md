# Codex usage and remaining limit notes

Date checked: 2026-07-15.

## Official model

Codex has two materially different accounting paths:

- ChatGPT sign-in: Codex usage follows the ChatGPT workspace, plan, RBAC, retention, and residency settings. The plan exposes usage limits and credits through ChatGPT/Codex account surfaces.
- API key sign-in: Codex usage follows the OpenAI Platform organization and standard API token pricing.

Official Codex pages used:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing
- https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth
- https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server
- https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands
- https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/settings

## Account remaining limit

The stable-looking local path is Codex app-server JSON-RPC:

1. Start `codex app-server` over stdio.
2. Send `initialize` with `capabilities.experimentalApi = true`.
3. Send `initialized`.
4. Call:
   - `account/read`
   - `account/rateLimits/read`
   - `account/usage/read`

The generated schema for the installed Codex 0.144.2 runtime includes:

- `GetAccountRateLimitsResponse`
- `RateLimitSnapshot`
- `RateLimitWindow`
- `RateLimitResetCreditsSummary`
- `RateLimitResetCredit`
- `GetAccountTokenUsageResponse`
- `AccountTokenUsageSummary`

`account/rateLimits/read` returns rolling windows as percentages, not absolute token quota numbers. The response uses nullable `primary` and `secondary` transport slots. Those slot names do not define a fixed 5-hour or 7-day meaning; clients must classify each returned window by `windowDurationMins`. Known durations today: 300 (5h), 10080 (7d), and calendar-month style windows in the 28–31 day range (for example Team accounts returning 43800 minutes). The domain snapshot preserves 5h, 7d, and monthly windows independently, including responses that contain 7d and monthly together; display order and Palette primary/secondary roles are assigned only in the UI.

Observed response combinations on this machine include:

- primary: 300 minutes, secondary: 10080 minutes
- primary: 10080 minutes, secondary: null
- each window has `usedPercent` and `resetsAt`

The same response can include the optional top-level `rateLimitResetCredits` object. Its required `availableCount` is the authoritative number of earned reset credits currently available. The optional `credits` array is detail-only: `null` means the backend returned only the count, and the backend may cap the array, so clients must not infer the count from its length. Missing `rateLimitResetCredits` means unsupported or unknown; it is not treated as zero. A present count of zero means the account supports the field but has no available reset credits.

codexU reads `availableCount` and the optional `expiresAt` Unix timestamp from each returned available-credit detail row. It does not infer missing rows or expiry dates: when the backend omits or caps `credits`, the UI keeps the authoritative total and marks the unmatched expiry details as unavailable. Backend titles and descriptions are not displayed. codexU never calls `account/rateLimitResetCredit/consume`, because redeeming a credit is an account mutation and this widget is read-only.

The widget therefore normalizes all returned slots before exposing quota data to the UI:

- 300 minutes: 5-hour quota
- 10080 minutes: 7-day quota
- missing, duplicate, or unknown durations: left unclassified and never labeled as 5-hour or 7-day quota

So this widget computes account remaining limit as:

```text
remainingPercent = 100 - usedPercent
```

That is a real account-limit percentage from Codex, but it is not an absolute number of turns, messages, or tokens.

## Local token usage

Codex keeps local thread inventory in `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`. The `threads` table has a `tokens_used` column. This widget uses it for local historical usage:

- lifetime: sum of all `threads.tokens_used`
- today: sum where `threads.updated_at` is after local day start
- last 7 days: sum where `threads.updated_at` is in the current local 7-day window

This is useful for local activity tracking, but it is not the authoritative remaining account quota. A thread can be updated later, so daily grouping is an approximation based on last update time.

## Detailed local token usage

Codex session JSONL files under `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions/*.jsonl` include `event_msg` records with `payload.type = token_count`. Those records expose:

- `input_tokens`
- `cached_input_tokens`
- `output_tokens`
- `reasoning_output_tokens`
- `total_tokens`

The widget treats `cached_input_tokens` as a subset of input tokens. Cost estimation therefore uses:

```text
uncached_input = input_tokens - cached_input_tokens
estimated_cost =
  uncached_input / 1M * input_price
+ cached_input_tokens / 1M * cached_input_price
+ output_tokens / 1M * output_price
```

`reasoning_output_tokens` is shown only as a sub-detail of output and is not added again for cost.

The JSONL stream can contain repeated cumulative token snapshots, so the parser computes deltas from consecutive `total_token_usage` snapshots per session instead of summing every record directly. For daily and monthly buckets, each positive delta is assigned to the timestamp of its `token_count` event. This is more precise than grouping a whole thread by `threads.updated_at`, but it is still a local estimate rather than an official invoice.

## What this widget intentionally avoids

- It does not read `~/.codex/auth.json` token values.
- It does not call private ChatGPT web endpoints directly.
- It does not parse prompt or tool payloads from session logs; it filters only `token_count` event lines.

## Current implementation choice

The widget displays both kinds of data separately:

- Account limit remaining: from `account/rateLimits/read`
- Available rate-limit resets: `rateLimitResetCredits.availableCount`, with per-credit expiry from optional `credits[].expiresAt`
- Local token usage: from `threads.tokens_used`
- Detailed token split and API-equivalent value: from local JSONL `token_count` events, with SQLite as the source of session paths and model names.

If app-server is unavailable, the widget falls back to SQLite-only mode and marks account-limit data as unavailable.

## Claude Code local support

Claude Code does not expose the same local `account/rateLimits/read` app-server API as Codex. v0.4.0 therefore separates historical usage from active quota:

- Historical token usage: parsed from assistant `message.usage` fields in `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`.
- Cache split: `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` are mapped into the widget's cached input bucket so existing UI cards can show uncached/cached/output splits.
- Project attribution: uses transcript `cwd` first, then best-effort decoding of the Claude project directory name.
- Tool usage: counts only `tool_use.name`; it does not retain tool arguments or output.
- Skill usage: uses explicit Skill attribution fields when present and the `Skill` tool name as a fallback.
- Task board: reads `~/.claude/tasks/**/*.json` status and subject fields.
- Active quota: optional `~/Library/Caches/codexU/claude-code/statusline-snapshot.json` with 5-hour and 7-day used percentages. Missing snapshots are shown as unavailable, and snapshots older than 15 minutes are marked stale.

Claude Code API-equivalent value is an estimate from a small built-in Claude model price table. Unknown models still contribute tokens, but their dollar value is omitted from the estimate.
