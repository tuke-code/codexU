codexU is a native desktop widget project for tracking OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT Codex quota, token usage, and today's task status. This repository now contains isolated native implementations for macOS, Ubuntu Desktop, and Windows.

## Who It Is For

- Developers who use OpenAI Codex, Codex CLI, or the Codex desktop app every day.
- ChatGPT Pro / Team users who want a quick view of Codex 5-hour quota, 7-day quota, token usage, and reset times.
- macOS users who want to check Codex status without repeatedly opening a browser or terminal.

## Features

- Shows remaining and used Codex quota for the 5-hour and 7-day windows, including reset times.
- Summarizes token usage for today, the last 7 days, and lifetime totals with uncached input, cached input, and output splits.
- Estimates the current month's API-equivalent value from OpenAI API token prices and shows progress against Plus, Pro 100, Pro 200, and the full monthly quota value.
- Builds a daily task board from local Codex threads and enabled Codex automations.
- Groups work into active, pending, scheduled, and done columns.
- Stays on the desktop layer by default, with `Command + U` foreground toggle.
- Supports Chinese and English UI text. The default language follows the system time zone, and the top `中 | EN` switch can override it.
- Supports system, light, and dark appearance modes. The default follows macOS, and the top appearance switch can override it.
- Reads data locally and does not upload usage, threads, or account data to a third-party service.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 14+ | Supported | SwiftUI/AppKit, distributed as DMG. |
| Ubuntu Desktop 24.04+ | Supported | GTK4/PyGObject, distributed as `.deb`; GNOME Wayland does not expose a true desktop layer or global hotkeys. |
| Windows 10 1903+ / Windows 11 | Supported | .NET 8 WPF, distributed as zip; tray and topmost mode stand in for the macOS desktop layer. |

See [docs/PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md](docs/PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md) for the multi-platform plan and [docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md](docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md) for repository layout rules.
See [Platforms/Ubuntu/README.md](Platforms/Ubuntu/README.md) for Ubuntu and [Platforms/Windows/README.md](Platforms/Windows/README.md) for Windows.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Command + U`: toggle the widget between desktop layer and foreground layer.
- Menu bar gauge icon: same toggle as `Command + U`.
- Top appearance switch: switch between system, light, and dark modes. System mode follows macOS.
- Top `中 | EN` switch: switch between Chinese and English. Manual selection is kept for the next launch.
- Refresh button: immediately refresh quota, token usage, trend, and task board.
- Close button: quit the widget.
- Drag anywhere on the widget background to reposition it.

## First Install: Privacy & Security

codexU is distributed outside the Mac App Store. On first launch, macOS may block it until you manually allow it:

1. Open `codexU.app` once. If macOS says it cannot be opened, cancel the dialog.
2. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**.
3. In the **Security** section, click **Open Anyway** for `codexU.app`.
4. Confirm with Touch ID or your password, then click **Open**.

You can also right-click `codexU.app` in Finder and choose **Open**, then confirm the same security prompt.

codexU needs access to local Codex data under `~/.codex/`. If macOS asks for file or folder access, allow it so the widget can read local usage, threads, and automation metadata.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later.
- A local Codex installation.
- A signed-in Codex account for quota data.
- Codex must have been used at least once so `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` exists.
- Xcode Command Line Tools for building from source.

## Build From Source

Validate SwiftPM package metadata:

```sh
swift package dump-package
```

```sh
make build
```

Run the app:

```sh
make run
```

Install to `/Applications`:

```sh
make install
```

Inspect the data source output:

```sh
make probe
```

Run repository-level CI checks:

```sh
make ci
```

Ubuntu native app:

```sh
cd Platforms/Ubuntu
./scripts/verify.sh
python3 -m codexu_ubuntu
```

Windows native app:

```powershell
cd Platforms\Windows
.\scripts\verify.ps1
dotnet run --project .\CodexU.Windows\CodexU.Windows.csproj
```

## Package A DMG

```sh
make release
```

`make release` builds a DMG for the current build machine architecture. You can also build explicit Mac architectures:

```sh
make release-arm64
make release-intel
make release-all
```

Release artifacts are written to `dist/`, for example:

```text
dist/codexU-0.2.0-mac-arm64.dmg
dist/codexU-0.2.0-mac-arm64.dmg.sha256
dist/codexU-0.2.0-mac-x86_64.dmg
dist/codexU-0.2.0-mac-x86_64.dmg.sha256
```

For Developer ID signing and notarization, see [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md).

Ubuntu `.deb` and Windows zip packaging commands are documented in each platform README. The GitHub Release artifact workflow builds macOS DMGs, the Ubuntu DEB, and the Windows ZIP.

## Data Sources

- Account and quota: `codex app-server` JSON-RPC methods `account/read`, `account/rateLimits/read`, and `account/usage/read`.
- Local token totals: `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite`.
- Detailed token splits: `token_count` events in `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` and `~/.codex/archived_sessions/*.jsonl`.
- Today's board: unarchived and archived Codex threads in the local SQLite database.
- Scheduled tasks: enabled automation metadata under `~/.codex/automations/**/automation.toml`.

Current Codex quota APIs expose rolling-window percentages and reset times, not absolute account quota sizes. See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for the data model and fallback behavior.

## FAQ

### Is codexU an official OpenAI product?

No. codexU is an unofficial local macOS utility for reading local Codex app-server responses and local `~/.codex/` data.

### Does codexU upload my Codex threads or usage data?

No. codexU reads Codex quota, local SQLite usage, and automation metadata locally. It does not upload that data to a third-party service.

### Why does codexU show remaining percentage instead of absolute quota?

The current local Codex API exposes rolling-window usage percentages and reset times, not absolute quota sizes. codexU therefore shows remaining percentages for the 5-hour and 7-day windows.

### Does codexU support Intel Macs?

Yes. Intel Macs should use `codexU-<version>-mac-x86_64.dmg`. From source, package it with `make release-intel`, or override `TARGET_TRIPLE="x86_64-apple-macos14.0"` from a compatible toolchain.
